First Maker's Academy Friday challenge - Airport challenge.

To start with I have tried to keep the number of classes small as I understand this better however I do realise that this isn't best practice and will try to incorporate dependency injection. I plan to do this by firstly revisiting Boris_Bikes as I only got up to challenge 21 which meant that I never used mixins, which is something I think I could use here by incoporating the plane into the airport. I again realise that this isn't best practice as if someone changed the plane it would affect the airport. I have now created more classes 
    so that the behaviour of my aiport class is reduced. Still need more work on mixins.
